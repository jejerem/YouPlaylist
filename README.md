# you_play_list

YouPlaylist is an app I made in Flutter&Dart for listening to your favorite songs or any other audios on youtube for free and in background !
In this app you can connect to your google account to enjoy listening to your favorite playlists.

Moreover you will find two modes : 

- Loop mode : Available for playlists and videos in research. 
  Automatically activated for videos in search and disactivated for playlists but you can change it whenever you want by clicking on the player.

- Shuffle mode: Only available for playlists. You can activate it through the player page.

In the app you will find different players with the same behavior :

- For videos in search : 

  - the left arrow is to go 10 seconds backward in the song
  - the right arrow is to go 10 seconds forward in the song
  - the play button to resume/pause the video
  - Loop mode : Play the current video in loop.
  
- For videos in playlists:

  - The left arrow is to play the previous song
  - The left arrow is to play the next song
  - The play button to resume/pause the video
  - The loop mode button to play the current video in loop.
  - The shuffle mode button to shuffle the current playlist.
 
For updates, the user is warned when there is a new update with a request system working with Google Drive.
